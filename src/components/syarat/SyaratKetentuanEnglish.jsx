We do not have an employment relationship as regulated by labor law regulations with doctors/healthcare professionals who interact with you, and we are not responsible for the validity or accuracy of the information/statements you provide to doctors/healthcare professionals who interact with you, including the occurrence of actions, negligence, omissions, and/or errors of doctors/healthcare professionals resulting in injury, death, damage, direct or indirect loss, material or immaterial.

                        Certain functions of the application will require the application to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but PT Fitaja Digital Nusantara (FDN) cannot be held responsible for applications that do not function fully if you do not have access to Wi-Fi, and you do not have any remaining data quota.

                        If you use the application outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your agreement terms with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile network provider for the cost of data during the connection while accessing the application, or any other third-party charges. By using the application, you accept responsibility for such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the application outside your home territory (i.e., region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you are using the application, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer to use the application.
